Tax savings amount(s) will generally be lower.\n- [ ] In 2023 the taxpayer could have contributed $7,500 to a traditional IRA, with estimated tax savings of $1,650, or the taxpayer could have contributed $7,500 to a Roth IRA (assuming no other changes). Contributions can be made up until April 15th, 2024. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.138,r=0.897,b=0.276), with ID 2c61b539-b7ae-4a41-afad-eb90469fa599 -->\n\n## Future Tax Savings\n\n- [ ] For the purpose of determining tax savings on issues listed below, the Qualified Business Income Deduction was not re-computed. Tax savings amount(s) will generally be lower.\n- [ ] In 2024 the taxpayer can contribute $8,000 to a traditional IRA, with estimated tax savings of $1,760, or the taxpayer can contribute $8,000 to a Roth IRA (assuming no other changes). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.335,r=0.890,b=0.457), with ID 544872fe-2a7c-40bc-b9db-473872f2ee08 -->\n\n## Tax Tips\n\n- [ ] Taxable income is $76,346, placing the taxpayer in a 22% marginal tax bracket. Based on 2023 tax rates, income would have to increase by over $19,029 in order for any income to begin being taxed in the 24% bracket. This may be used as a guide in determining the advantages or disadvantages of receiving discretionary income in 2024.\n\n- [ ] For itemized and standard deduction purposes, married filing separate taxpayers must consent to the same method of deduction. Ensure that both spouse's are using the same method.\n\n- [ ] Paying discretionary itemized deductions (Property Taxes and Gifts to Charity) before the end of the year, or postponing discretionary itemized deductions until after the year end, could prove to be beneficial to this taxpayer, since itemized deductions are very close in value to the standard deduction. However, caution should be exercised. If the taxpayer is subject to AMT or close to being subject to AMT, the expected benefits from property tax payments may be reduced. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.515,r=0.901,b=0.763), with ID bd361d3e-83f1-411b-922e-7cde75ccf4c0 -->\n\n## Compliance Tips\n\n- [ ] Passthrough Entity RKR Bottling LLC: Material participation must be determined on an annual basis. Ensure that adequate proof of participation exists. Proof of participation includes any reasonable method, such as showing the services performed and the approximate number of hours spent by using an appointment book, calendar, or narrative summary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.819,r=0.909,b=0.923), with ID 85d94ee4-c75a-4584-8c4a-4144ba69d382 -->\n\n## Document Information\n\n- **Year**: 2023\n- **Document Type**: Tax Analysis\n- **Page**: 2\n\n## Personal Information\n\n- **Name**: Khalid Shaba\n- **ID Number**: 625-60-5125\n\nThis crop from a document titled \"Tax Analysis\" for the year 2023, page 2, includes the name \"Khalid Shaba\" and an ID number \"625-60-5125\". <!-- form, from page 1 (l=0.059,t=0.046,r=0.943,b=0.112), with ID 64de6d48-87d2-4f44-8d9a-95376a73da80 -->\n\n## Schedule A Comparison Flags\n\n- [ ] Schedule A state and local taxes are 15% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A real estate taxes are 231% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A total taxes paid are 20% lower than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A home mortgage interest reported on Form 1098 is 29% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A total interest paid deduction is 26% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A total itemized deductions are 31% lower than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.081,t=0.138,r=0.891,b=0.368), with ID dfd69df9-16e1-40f9-9c3d-7920d8b6ca45 -->\n\n## Social Security\n\n- [ ] Based upon age, the taxpayer will be eligible for early retirement benefits in May, 2024, and full retirement benefits in May, 2029.\n- [ ] If you choose to receive retirement benefits early, your monthly benefit will be permanently reduced by up to 35%. The actual reduction is based upon the number of months you retire early.\n- [ ] Until you reach full retirement age, earned income can significantly reduce your SS benefits (potentially to zero). If you choose to receive SS benefits early, they will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn above the earnings threshold, which is $21,240 in 2023. Note that this reduction only applies until you reach full retirement age. After that, earned income doesn't impact the benefits you receive and your monthly benefits will even increase to compensate for the prior year reductions. A special rule applies to the threshold in the 1st year you retire. Since you could have significant pre-retirement earnings in that year, you can look at each month independently, and if earned income is less than $1,770, you receive benefits for that month. Another special rule applies to the year you reach full retirement age. In that year, the reduced benefit is computed as $1 for every $3 above a higher threshold, which is $56,520 in 2023. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.080,t=0.425,r=0.911,b=0.719), with ID be755277-1c1a-47f7-ab26-bd9af9cefe68 -->\n\n## 2023 <!-- page_header, from page 0 (l=0.066,t=0.061,r=0.119,b=0.075), with ID 54881626-6a3b-425e-aca8-25037d50d43b -->\n\n# Schedule A Analysis <!-- title, from page 0 (l=0.390,t=0.061,r=0.615,b=0.079), with ID 07382dd7-83b0-4b18-9b2e-9e36c9308806 -->\n\n## Page Header\n\n- **Name**: Khalid Shaba\n- **Number**: 625-60-5125 <!-- page_header, from page 0 (l=0.450,t=0.095,r=0.938,b=0.106), with ID 0d298d75-1b5a-4203-8daa-191be8f47cbc -->\n\n## AGI Range Used for This Analysis\n\n**$100,000 -

Individual Income Tax Returns with Itemized Deductions (Tax Year 2021), posted on the IRS website. The typical column is reflective of taxpayers who claimed the deduction only. Typical amounts are expressed as a percentage of AGI, using the average AGI and average deduction claimed for taxpayers within the given range. As an example, the table may indicate that the average AGI for taxpayers within the $75,000 to $99,999 AGI range is $87,315 and that the average deduction for cash contributions (for those claiming it) within the same AGI range is $5,518. The Schedule A Analysis assumes that the typical cash contribution for a taxpayer within this range is 6.32% ($5,518 divided by $87,315) of the taxpayer's actual AGI.\n\n- **Above or below the user specified range.** <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.712,r=0.910,b=0.811), with ID 28ca3f45-3cb2-46d4-b4b0-bda72d6b6e58 -->\n\n## Page Footer\n\nFDIL3701L  01/15/23 <!-- page_footer, from page 0 (l=0.449,t=0.943,r=0.549,b=0.950), with ID be103571-1e68-4c2c-97a6-4daa7f225522 -->\n\n## Address Information\n\n- **Mail to:**\n  - **Internal Revenue Service**\n    - P.O.

Tax savings amount(s) will generally be lower.\n- [ ] In 2023 the taxpayer could have contributed $7,500 to a traditional IRA, with estimated tax savings of $1,650, or the taxpayer could have contributed $7,500 to a Roth IRA (assuming no other changes). Contributions can be made up until April 15th, 2024. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.138,r=0.897,b=0.276), with ID 90996a37-dee5-4252-9caf-d1b056a7bd58 -->\n\n## Future Tax Savings\n\n- [ ] For the purpose of determining tax savings on issues listed below, the Qualified Business Income Deduction was not re-computed. Tax savings amount(s) will generally be lower.\n- [ ] In 2024 the taxpayer can contribute $8,000 to a traditional IRA, with estimated tax savings of $1,760, or the taxpayer can contribute $8,000 to a Roth IRA (assuming no other changes). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.335,r=0.890,b=0.457), with ID 616fcfb1-1568-4bad-a860-350f9a9eda4f -->\n\n## Tax Tips\n\n- [ ] Taxable income is $76,346, placing the taxpayer in a 22% marginal tax bracket. Based on 2023 tax rates, income would have to increase by over $19,029 in order for any income to begin being taxed in the 24% bracket. This may be used as a guide in determining the advantages or disadvantages of receiving discretionary income in 2024.\n\n- [ ] For itemized and standard deduction purposes, married filing separate taxpayers must consent to the same method of deduction. Ensure that both spouse's are using the same method.\n\n- [ ] Paying discretionary itemized deductions (Property Taxes and Gifts to Charity) before the end of the year, or postponing discretionary itemized deductions until after the year end, could prove to be beneficial to this taxpayer, since itemized deductions are very close in value to the standard deduction. However, caution should be exercised. If the taxpayer is subject to AMT or close to being subject to AMT, the expected benefits from property tax payments may be reduced. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.515,r=0.901,b=0.763), with ID 17984852-d25f-4b7a-afbd-62cfd5b9abea -->\n\n## Compliance Tips\n\n- [ ] Passthrough Entity RKR Bottling LLC: Material participation must be determined on an annual basis. Ensure that adequate proof of participation exists. Proof of participation includes any reasonable method, such as showing the services performed and the approximate number of hours spent by using an appointment book, calendar, or narrative summary. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.819,r=0.909,b=0.923), with ID 261bcf6a-eb6c-45f7-bf1e-287de86e04a9 -->\n\n### Tax Analysis Document Header\n\n- **Year**: 2023\n- **Document Type**: Tax Analysis\n- **Page Number**: Page 2\n- **Name**: Khalid Shaba\n- **SSN**: 625-60-5125 <!-- page_header, from page 1 (l=0.059,t=0.046,r=0.943,b=0.112), with ID 21fa78bd-704f-43e7-b87a-b61463856e1a -->\n\n## Schedule A Comparison Flags\n\n- [ ] Schedule A state and local taxes are 15% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A real estate taxes are 231% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A total taxes paid are 20% lower than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A home mortgage interest reported on Form 1098 is 29% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A total interest paid deduction is 26% higher than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI.\n- [ ] Schedule A total itemized deductions are 31% lower than the typical amount deducted by taxpayers claiming the deduction, with similar AGI. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.081,t=0.138,r=0.891,b=0.368), with ID eb6d50eb-e968-44b5-827d-663e444169ea -->\n\n## Social Security\n\n- [ ] Based upon age, the taxpayer will be eligible for early retirement benefits in May, 2024, and full retirement benefits in May, 2029.\n\n- [ ] If you choose to receive retirement benefits early, your monthly benefit will be permanently reduced by up to 35%. The actual reduction is based upon the number of months you retire early.\n\n- [ ] Until you reach full retirement age, earned income can significantly reduce your SS benefits (potentially to zero). If you choose to receive SS benefits early, they will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn above the earnings threshold, which is $21,240 in 2023. Note that this reduction only applies until you reach full retirement age. After that, earned income doesn't impact the benefits you receive and your monthly benefits will even increase to compensate for the prior year reductions. A special rule applies to the threshold in the 1st year you retire. Since you could have significant pre-retirement earnings in that year, you can look at each month independently, and if earned income is less than $1,770, you receive benefits for that month. Another special rule applies to the year you reach full retirement age. In that year, the reduced benefit is computed as $1 for every $3 above a higher threshold, which is $56,520 in 2023. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.080,t=0.425,r=0.911,b=0.719), with ID 82a7d3c9-9245-40eb-a8b3-deea4a01dd8e -->\n\n## 2023\n\n <!-- page_header, from page 0 (l=0.066,t=0.061,r=0.119,b=0.075), with ID ce8eaedb-e03a-4c0b-bf8b-cea31f5160b4 -->\n\n# Schedule A Analysis <!-- title, from page 0 (l=0.390,t=0.061,r=0.615,b=0.079), with ID c7c3171e-96ef-46db-94f0-9e824597638c -->\n\n## Page Header\n\n- **Name**: Khalid Shaba\n- **Number**: 625-60-5125 <!-- page_header, from page 0 (l=0.450,t=0.095,r=0.938,b=0.106), with ID fef9f605-cd5b-47cc-89dd-baa8c75a49e3 -->\n\n## AGI Range Used for This Analysis\n\n**$100,000 -
